# Practice with CSS Grid

I was listening to a podcast on CSS this morning on the way to work,
and the guest, Rachel Andrew was talking about CSS grid. It sounded pretty neat,
so I thought I'd code-up a simple little page to get a little practice. Also,
one of my projects for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree requires me to make
contributions for 14 days in a row, and this little number should be good for
at least a few days.

So, for this little page, I set-up two design objectives/requirements:
* Use six HTML sematics tags
* Use CSS Grid to display like this image (thanks W3 Schools):

Grid layout
3 columns
7 rows
header: 1 rows x 3 columns
nav: 1 rows X 3 columns
section: 2 rows x 2 columns
article: 2 rows x 2 columns
aside: 2 rows x 1 columns
footer: 1 row x 3 columns
